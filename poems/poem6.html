                    When the sky blends with the setting sun
                    Do you call it giving up or becoming one with the sun?
                    When it pours, is the cloud crying or the water too strong to be held by the clouds?
                    Is the candle burning for others or guiding them?
                    Do you love to be loved or do you love being in it?
                    Do you find yourself in the search or do you  accept your own self ?
                    When you look at your reflection, 
                    Are you too much for yourself or too little for others?
