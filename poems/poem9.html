                    How enduring is the night
                    Silence engulfing itself
                    The heavy breathes soothing the air around us as we drift.
                    A pause of reality . 
                    And yet ,
                    The mind wanders to a place looking for one,
                    where I am more closer to be felt
                    A place thats forgotten when I wake
                    And yet I wake up to be forgotten in someone's dream.
                    I wake up to a reality of silence within
                    striving through out the day
                    Until the silence engulfs the surrounding again.
