                    The sea and the sand
                    The depth is feared
                    The eye opaque to the boundless strech
                    The waves ebbs n flows within you
                    Gushing to be held by the sand
                    And then resolving all of you in it.
                    Are you engulfing the anchored sand or
                    The unquenched sand taking in all of you?
                    For one of them falls into the porous arms of the other.
                    One fills the voids,
                    The other weighing the depths
                    A monotonous wave hitting the once rock
                    Inseparable yet solitary.
