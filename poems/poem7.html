                    The sky above me is different than yours,
                    Two wanderers searching for the same home.
                    And when the clouds hit,
                    For a glimpse atleast, the world felt like a factual illusion.
                    The walks on the streets, hearing the talks of the trees.
                    Pouring is the rain, washing all our words in vain.
                    We walk the same steps , in the same reps.
                    A home for two, the magic felt by very few.
                    The clock strikes 12,
                    And that's how two old souls met to dwell.
