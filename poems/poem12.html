                    I'll be me again someday,
                    Meeting in new places,
                    Grasping through past people.
                    I'll meet her through the words of others,
                    I'll remember her through their choices.
                    The days drifting us apart,
                    What's left feels too much,
                    The lost always feeling close.
                    Missing is a part of the whole,
                    Searching is a part of the found.
                    Is she in me, or am I the reflection of her?
                    With a pen and a book full of narrations,
                    Through the words of her own,
                    I've met her again,
                    Writing to be herself someday.
