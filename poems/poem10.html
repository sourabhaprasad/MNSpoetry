                    Sometimes I wonder am like the waters.
                    Gushing and rumbling in search of a new trench,
                    Is this where we resolve?
                    Bewildered to stay, 
                    delighted to depart.
                    Resistant to dwell, 
                    for the home is where we  drift with the unceasing current.
                    Gushing and rumbling in search of a new trench.
                    A memory of the water we are, 
                    withstanding to dissolve,
                    We are the wanders who aren't lost.
