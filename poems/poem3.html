                    Your light passing through me,
                    To our future far apart to be.
                    You are the star far away to reach
                    And I'm the immobile planet restrained to leave.
                    I follow your spins watching your rythms.
                    A never setting star, leaving me with a scar.
                    Someday We aligned with our future
                    Nearing you and the future,
                    concealing your brightness
                    They call it an eclipse
                    Perfectly aligned,
                    starts to decline
                    A beautiful disaster lasting for few.
