                    Where have you been wondering lately ?
                    Are you in deepest forest finding a cure ?
                    Or are you in the wild, surviving on those diseased thoughts ?
                    Are you in that beautiful valley you created ?
                    Or are you in that destroyed barren lands?
                    Are you on those high mountains hearing your echoes ?
                    Or are you being carried by the waved of your past ?
                    Are you a lost soul finding his way back home ?
                    Or are you a soul lost in his own home ?
                </p>
