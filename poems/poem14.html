                    A home is dark and that's where I reside ,
                    Breathing the air of fear.
                    The cries unheard even to the walls around me.
                    The plants and yard belong to it and so does my guilt and fame.
                    Conversation is an act of one,
                    Surrounding me is the silence,
                    Balancing the chattering birds in my head.
                    For they never knew the sky
                    And i never saw the bright.
                    A home is dark and that's where i live,
                    Breathing death for my lungs to be pleased.
