                    Into the limitless path of dying hope,
                    I weapon the withering light.
                    A maze looks like an undiscovered path they said,
                    A nomad's perfect muse they didn't warn of.
                    And thus, into the maze I ponder.
                    Deeper the roads, familiar the neighbouring,
                    The faces I know, the stories I don't.
                    Resonating the paths but played my our own.
                    Some resisting the fate some accepting it as their own.
                    A home, we wish had never found our paths,
                    An aimless journey to the comfort of discovering the unknown.
                    We depart to a maze we call Pain.
