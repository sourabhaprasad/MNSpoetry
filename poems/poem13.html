            <p>
                To the one that cares the most.
                
                You sense a change in their tone.
                The steps that don't match yesterday's,
                The energy altered and the vibe that never matched.
                For someone like you, this is all you need to know,
                The other person is not okay.
                The one that gets anxious for the slightest inconvenience in their lives,
                You take a mental picture of the way they walk.
                The way they pick a fork in their right hand and spoon in their left,
                How they talk about something they love and the way they laugh.
                Not because you are obsessed,
                But because you don't want people to feel left out and unattended.
                You don't want anyone to go down that path you've managed to get out of,
                You consider people worthy of all your love and care.
                Just like a flower in the garden that blooms for the people around,
                Giving all they have got to make the other feel at home.
                After all of your unconditional giving,
                To the people that sometimes crush you too.
                Someday, amidst the roles of a giver and receiver,
                Don't you want to go home too?
