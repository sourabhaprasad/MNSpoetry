                    The idea you wish you were,
                    The reality you want to be,
                    Labels changing like clothes,
                    Definitions akin the weather.
                    The one you want to be is in the mirror,
                    But the eyes are outwards.
                    Some inspire from miles apart,
                    Some depress by feets apart.
                    Some real, some appearing so,
                    The dream you see
                    The wish you want to be , and
                    the desire you devour
                    Is it called being yourself?
